Group 9: Kevin Burdick, Kevin Chang, Michael Conway, Haike Yuan

We were unable to finish on time, but here is what is here:

Files:
client/               Client implementation (Java)

The following are in a rough state, as all were abandoned before completion.
server/               Initial attempt at server (C)
    CTP_server.{c,h}    Early server implementation (Haike Yuan)
    parsing.c           Early message parsing (Haike Yuan)
                        (based on misunderstanding of spec)
    options.{c,h}       Option handling (Michael Conway)
    message.{c,h}       Message parsing and sending (Michael Conway)
    protocol.{c,h}      Protocol implementation (Michael Conway)
    textbuf.{h,c}       Shared text "buffer" (Michael Conway)
    makefile            Makefile (Michael Conway; next to nothing yet)

To keep things simple, the server was planned to have a few shortcomings,
namely no user authentication, and simple DoS attacks by clients that hold the
lock indefinitely or stop a message midway through sending. These could be
solved using timers and/or threads at the cost of complexity.
