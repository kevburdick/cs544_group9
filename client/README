#### Included Files ####
README    # This file
Makefile  # Used to build client and test server 
message   # Directory that holds all the classes for the messages
test      # Directory that holds all the classes for the tests including a server class  


#### Environment ####
Compiler: java version "1.6.0_27"


#### Instructions ####
To compile:
in client directory type "make"

To run test server:
type "java -cp ./test:. Server" in  client directory

To run client:
type "java client" in client directory


#### Code Design ####
Code is broken up by message directory, test directory, client, CTP, and Transport. 
Below is a brief description. 
of the code organization for the client application. 
1) The transport file and class defines the transport layer of the protocol in this 
case the TCP socket. 
2) The client file holds that main method and entry into the application
3) The CTP file defines the state machine, DFA, for the CTP protocol and provides an 
interface to the upper layer.
3) The message directory includes all the message classes including the base Message 
class that all other message types inherit from.
4) The test directory contains the test server application to support testing of 
the client application.   

#### Testing ####
1) Open two shells one for server and one for client
2) Client and Server file have a series of messages that support a scenario
3) run Server and run Client(see commands above)
4) Should execute a series of events and pass messages back and forth and then exit
